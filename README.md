The solution is deployed on https://url-hashing.herokuapp.com/

Using Express JS over Node with MongoDB as the Database. Used EJS as a View to serve as UI with the data.

1. MongoDB - No SQL database provides scalability in the long run with high Read and Write Rates with the provision of using multiples server instances controlled                by a co-ordination service.
2. Node JS - Easy to create REST APIs with Javascript with plethora of modules available with NPM.
3. Express : Facilitiates Routing.
4. EJS - Apt for our objective. Serves the purpose completely.

Node NPM with Express made the base for the two APIs created which are used for URL Hashing. I hosted a free-tier Cluster on the MongoDB Cloud.

Other Modules/Dependencies utilized:

1. Nodemon
2. dotenv
3. body-parser
4. shortid
5. ejs
