Using Express JS over Node with MongoDB as the Database.

1. MongoDB - No SQL database provides scalability in the long run with high Read and Write Rates with the provision of using multiples server instances controlled                by a co-ordination service.
2. Node JS - Easy to create REST APIs with Javascript with plethora of modules available with NPM.
3. Express : Facilitiates Routing.

Node NPM with Express made the base for the two APIs created which are used for URL Hashing. I hosted a free-tier Cluster on the MongoDB Cloud.
