Some of the features I would like to add to the existing functionality:

1. A simple UI which would accept the URL to be hashed and return the Hashed API back to the user.
2. Load Balancers - To cater to high traffic with increased read and write rates co-ordinated by a system such as Apache Zookeeper.
3. Certain checks in the Hashing Algorithm to prevent race conditions.
